# SCRUM

From what i know, SCRUM is one of the popular process in agile development plan or you can also call it agile framework. SCRUM basically allows teams to focus on continuous improvement while building and iterating quickly. So, SCRUM team usually need time for them to improve from the first sprint and so on. On the first sprint is not a rare thing or you can say its common for the SCRUM team to start slow because they are still trying to build the team chemistry. The hope is that over time they will become more mature as a team.

Next, on SCRUM process there are several steps. This is the overall picture of SCRUM proces.

As we can see, there are several steps there.

## STEPS

### Product Backlog : On this steps or events, the SCRUM team need to identify what are the user needs and translate it into the product backlog. Product backlog itself contain several works that need to be implemented by the SCRUM team in order to create the product.

### Sprint Planning : Sprint planning is where the SCRUM team make a lists based on user priority and decide to choose what backlog they need to work on this sprint. SCRUM team can also divide the backlog they have into smaller task and put it into the SCRUM board.

### Sprint Backlog : Sprint backlog is basically the result of the sprint planning events. Sprint backlog contains the task that already divided on the previous events that need to be done on the particular sprint.

### Sprint Implementation : Sprint implementation is where the SCRUM team start to develop an implement the application based on the sprint backlog item that have been done on the previous step.

### Sprint Review : On this step or event what will be done are showcasing and reviewing the product development completed during the sprint, update the product backlog, and if possible project the release date based on feedback given.

### Sprint Retrospective : This step is simmilar to the sprint review. What makes it diferent is on this step the focus is more about the team development rather than the product development. So, in this step the SCRUM team will have a discussion about their performance and how tho achieve maximum efficiency.

### Daily Meetings : Daily meeting is the step where the SCRUM team, product owner, and SCRUM master meet daily and reporting about what have been done and consider to take on more task if the previous task is already done.

## SCRUM ROLES
### Product Owner : Product owner is someone who will set the product goals,ensure that the product backlog is already clear and updated, order the product backlog based on user priority, and will collect the feedback from user or stakeholders.

### SCRUM Master : SCRUM master is basically the leader of the SCRUM team. SCRUM master will helps the SCRUM team to perform at their highest level and performance. SCRUM master will also protect the team from both internal and external distraction.

### SCRUM Team : SCRUM team or developer team will manage the sprint backlog based on their capabilities, inspect and adapt through a daily SCRUM meetings, and contribute to the sprint goal that have been set in the beginning of the sprint.

## SCRUM VALUES
### Openness : Openness is needed to be able to build trust on the work environment. One of the example is having SCRUM board openly presented so everybody can see the progress of the sprint or even the whole development progress on the application or project. We need to be able to listen to people and their ideas.

### Courage : Basically courage is needed to give the SCRUM framework posibility to work at full power. The company or clients also need courage to make a decicions about trusting the SCRUM process.

### Focus : Focus is essential for the completion of our work. So we need to stay focus to be able to perform at our best and contribute to achieve the sprint goal or product goal.

### Respect : Respect is one of the crucial value in SCRUM. We need to respect each other as a team, as a product owner, as a SCRUM master, or even as a client. This will create a better work environment.

### Commitment : Commitment is the best way to achieve success in SCRUM project. We need to show commintment by doing our best to maximize the amount of work done during the sprint or development process.

# User Interface and User Experience

On this section i will share my knowledge about user interface.

User interface is basicaly the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. So, user interface is one of the important aspects for an application or a project. If you have a good user interface it will attract more pople to use your application. Other than that, user interface have a really strong connection with user experience. From what i know, if you have good user interface it will also give an impact to the better user experience.

Here are the difference between user interface and user experience designers

## 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

### 1: Visibility of system status : The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

### 2: Match between system and the real world : The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

### 3: User control and freedom : Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

### 4: Consistency and standards : Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

### 5: Error prevention : Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

### 6: Recognition rather than recall : Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use : Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

### 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design : Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

### 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors : Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

### 10: Help and documentation : It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.

As we can see above, if we consider and maximize the 10 usability heuristics we can create a "good" user interface design. As a result we can give our user best experience for using our application.

Another things that we can do to be a good user interface designer are preparing an alternative design so that user can choose the design that gives the user more satisfaction. Next we also have to consider about the best practices in user interface design such as consistency, simplicity, clarity, make the page layout useful, etc.

I hope this page will be usefull for any of you that reading this.

Thank you

Hello my name is Kevin Razaqa Aulia. This is my first post for this blog. First, on this post i want to share about my personal knowledge about the agile development plan specifically SCRUM.

From what i know, SCRUM is one of the popular process in agile development plan or you can also call it agile framework. SCRUM basically allows teams to focus on continuous improvement while building and iterating quickly. So, SCRUM team usually need time for them to improve from the first sprint and so on. On the first sprint is not a rare thing or you can say its common for the SCRUM team to start slow because they are still trying to build the team chemistry. The hope is that over time they will become more mature as a team.

Next, on SCRUM process there are several steps. This is the overall picture of SCRUM proces.

As we can see, there are several steps there.

# STEPS

Product Backlog : On this steps or events, the SCRUM team need to identify what are the user needs and translate it into the product backlog. Product backlog itself contain several works that need to be implemented by the SCRUM team in order to create the product.
Sprint Planning : Sprint planning is where the SCRUM team make a lists based on user priority and decide to choose what backlog they need to work on this sprint. SCRUM team can also divide the backlog they have into smaller task and put it into the SCRUM board.
Sprint Backlog : Sprint backlog is basically the result of the sprint planning events. Sprint backlog contains the task that already divided on the previous events that need to be done on the particular sprint.
Sprint Implementation : Sprint implementation is where the SCRUM team start to develop an implement the application based on the sprint backlog item that have been done on the previous step.
Sprint Review : On this step or event what will be done are showcasing and reviewing the product development completed during the sprint, update the product backlog, and if possible project the release date based on feedback given.
Sprint Retrospective : This step is simmilar to the sprint review. What makes it diferent is on this step the focus is more about the team development rather than the product development. So, in this step the SCRUM team will have a discussion about their performance and how tho achieve maximum efficiency.
Daily Meetings : Daily meeting is the step where the SCRUM team, product owner, and SCRUM master meet daily and reporting about what have been done and consider to take on more task if the previous task is already done.

# SCRUM ROLES
Product Owner : Product owner is someone who will set the product goals,ensure that the product backlog is already clear and updated, order the product backlog based on user priority, and will collect the feedback from user or stakeholders.
SCRUM Master : SCRUM master is basically the leader of the SCRUM team. SCRUM master will helps the SCRUM team to perform at their highest level and performance. SCRUM master will also protect the team from both internal and external distraction.
SCRUM Team : SCRUM team or developer team will manage the sprint backlog based on their capabilities, inspect and adapt through a daily SCRUM meetings, and contribute to the sprint goal that have been set in the beginning of the sprint.

# SCRUM VALUES
Openness : Openness is needed to be able to build trust on the work environment. One of the example is having SCRUM board openly presented so everybody can see the progress of the sprint or even the whole development progress on the application or project. We need to be able to listen to people and their ideas.
Courage : Basically courage is needed to give the SCRUM framework posibility to work at full power. The company or clients also need courage to make a decicions about trusting the SCRUM process.
Focus : Focus is essential for the completion of our work. So we need to stay focus to be able to perform at our best and contribute to achieve the sprint goal or product goal.
Respect : Respect is one of the crucial value in SCRUM. We need to respect each other as a team, as a product owner, as a SCRUM master, or even as a client. This will create a better work environment.
Commitment : Commitment is the best way to achieve success in SCRUM project. We need to show commintment by doing our best to maximize the amount of work done during the sprint or development process.

I hope this page will be usefull for any of you that reading this.
Thank you

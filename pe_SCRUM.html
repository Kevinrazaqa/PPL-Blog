          <!-- Post Content -->
          <h3 align="justify">On this section i will try to share more about the real implementation of SCRUM itself from the beginning. On my current project SPARQL me and my team use SCRUM as our process or framework.</h3>
          <hr>
          <h4 align="justify">Firstly, i will talk about my experience(on this project SPARQL) spesifically when we(me and my SCRUM team) arranged the product backlog. As we know, on this step we have to identify what are the user needs and translate it into the backlog. On this steps, we try to understand what are the user needs and discuss it in order to finish the backlog. There are some differences in understanding among the SCRUM team, but we managed to put it together and reach the point where we had the same thoughts about what are the user needs and then translate it into the product backlog.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Secondly, i will share my experience about the sprint planning steps. As we know, we need to do the sprint planning before actually do the sprint itself. On this steps, actually nothing really different from the actual definition of sprint planning itself. We as a SCRUM team made a list and discuss it with the user about the priority of the feature. Yes, maybe there is some argument about how many features that will be implemented on this sprint, but with the help of poker planning we can make some sort of difficulty level to those features and be more convidence about what we can implement on this sprint.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Thirdly, yes we did the sprint planning and get the sprint backlog as a result. The sprint backlog itself will actualy be our guide about this sprint. Then, we made the gitlab board after we discuss about what are the "work" that can be done. In this case, we look intu the product backlog and split the task into smaller tasks. Then, after that we also made a gitlab board to keep track of our work on this sprint. We made some sections such as To-do,Done,Bugs, etc.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Next, the sprint implementation, for now we are still working in this steps so i will share my experience maybe after we have finished the sprint implementation steps.</h4>

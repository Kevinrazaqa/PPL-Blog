          <h3 align="justify">From what i know, SCRUM is one of the popular process in agile development plan or you can also call it agile framework.SCRUM basically allows teams to focus on continuous improvement while building and iterating quickly. So, SCRUM team usually need time for them to improve from the first sprint and so on. On the first sprint is not a rare thing or you can say its common for the SCRUM team to start slow because they are still trying to build the team chemistry. The hope is that over time they will become more mature as a team.</h3>
          <hr>
          <h3 align="justify">Next, on SCRUM process there are several steps. This is the overall picture of SCRUM proces.</h3>

          <h2 align="justify">On this section i will focus on what we as a SCRUM team did on our project spesifically about the Quality Assurance</h2>
          <hr>
          <h4 align="justify">So, this section actually related to the other section which is the Test Driven Development section. So, maybe if you have not read that part you can also read that part to make it clear about what im going to share here. </h4>

          <img src="sonarqube.png" class="fit">
          <h4 align="justify">As we can see on the picture above, we connect our project to one of the tools that can helps us manage our code quality. In this case, we use sonarqube. As i mentioned before this section is actually related to the TDD section. Why? becase on this quality assurance tools such as sonarqube it tells us which code that has not been covered by a test or a unit test. The main reason is to make maintain the consistency and also minimizing the chance of bugs in our project. So, basically if all the code in the project are covered by a test it will decreasing the chance of unexpected bugs. Other than that, it can also tells us wether our code can be refactored so we can read the code easier.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Okay now lets talk about how do i improve the quality of the code itself. So, as we can see from the picture above there is a section that mentioned about code coverage. What exactly does code coverage means?</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Code coverage is simply the percentage of overall code that have been covered by a test. So if you want to improve the coverage of your code you will have to build a whole bunch of unit tests that can cover all of your code especially when it comes to the functionality test.</h4>

          <img src="Screenshot 2023-04-24 184346.png" class="fit">
          <h4 align="justify">So, here is some example of a test. As we can see i write a code that cover basically almost every function that i build spesifically on the login and register functionality of the project. This is one of a way how i help my team to increase the code coverage on our project.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Also we can also increase our code quality of our overall project. There is a couple way that i also did.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">First, Code refactoring for example making the function relatively small so that it also fulfill the best practices such as singe responsability principle.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Second, applying best practices such as reusability so there isn't a duplicated code everywhere on the project.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Third, reducing code smells. We can use the sonarlint extension on the visual studio code(my ide) to reduce our code smell while we writing our code.</h4>

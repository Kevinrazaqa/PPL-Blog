          <h4 align="justify">As i mentioned on my sprint process experience, we used gitlab to make our work easy to manage. We used gitlab board also to keep track of our team progresses. On this project, so far i have already commited a couple of tasks that i worked on. Other than that, i also did the merge request already to ask for validation from my team about my works. I did the merge request in order to see others(in this case my team) perspective of my works. The merge request itself also will have to be accepted with minimum two members of my team in order to validate my works. I can also know from the comment section of the merge request itself if there is something i need to revise about my works.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">On my Project, i often check the board also to see the progresses and of course update the board when it comes to my tasks to keep my team updated. The gitlab board in my oppinion is a very useful tools that can be used to support the SCRUM process of framework itself. Other than that, we can also make a couple of branches that more spesific about certain task. It also make it easier for the team to see if some features already done or maybe there is a bug on the code and maybe some other useful insight that can be gained from each branch.</h4>

          <h4 align="justify">so far thats all i can share, maybe i'll update later if there is some tools that i think will be useful to support our project.</h4>

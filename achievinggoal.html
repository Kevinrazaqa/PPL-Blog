          <h4 align="justify">Now, let us get into the details.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">First, bringing some idea. Okay, let us talk about the real example so you can understand it more easily. One of the example about bringing some idea to the project are when we discussed about one of the functionality. To be more spesific when we discussed about the submiting the answer key for dosen role. We as a SCRUM team bring some idea about how can dosen submit their answer key. We gave some options such as you can submit by text or maybe you can also submit the file .ttl directly to the website. This is one of the example that we did as a SCRUM team in order to achieve the user goal. </h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Second, pitching to the user. Okay basically this is also one of the things that we did every sprint review. We try to give some explanation about what we did on the sprint and also try to give our best to get the user to understand about what we did. We also explain about how can we achive the overall user goal each sprint step by step. </h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Third, Validate. we also did this every sprint review. So, basically we validate to the user about the project every sprint review so that the user can also gives their thoughts and maybe giving some advices or ideas that we can implement on the next sprint. We also ask about the current product and if there is anything that can be changed either about the UI or even the product functionality.</h4>

          <h3 align="justify">On this section i will try to share about my experience especially on this UI/UX or wireframing process on my project (SPARQL). As we know, there are a couple of best practice when we do the wireframing or designing process. We know that there is a guideline we can look up to as i mentioned it on the previous part of the blog which is the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. Actually on this project, when i build the wireframe or we can say the UI design, i tried to implement those 10 heuristics. I would like to say more and explain one by one of the 10 heuristics that i used but since the UI of my project is considered "small" and very simple then maybe i will only talk about a couple of the heuristics.</h3>
          <hr>
          <h4 align="justify">First, Aesthetic and minimalist design : on my design i tried to keep it simple with couple of buttons and field that are really needed in order to support the funcionality of my project.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Second, Consistency and standards : i tried to maintain the consistency also by matching the button colors and also design the we background to have not that much color.</h4>
          <h4 align="justify">Third, Recognition rather than recall : on my design, as i say its actually quite simple because all of the buttons and field is easy to understand and the user can recognize it easily what to do rather than have to recall what certain action will do what.</h4>
          <h3 align="justify">Maybe i will share it more later as the project progresses and i will update and try to explain more about the heuristics that i used.</h3>
